# openMINDS_SANDS

The openMINDS_SANDS repository is part of the open Metadata 
Initiative for Neuroscience Data Structures (openMINDS). It contains the 
schema-templates used for Spatial Anchoring of Neuroscience Data (SANDS).

For more information on openMINDS in general and the processing pipelines for the schema-templates please go to the main repository: https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS

## schemas
The SANDS v1.0 schemas are JSON-schema inspired schema-templates with a few custom template-properties (prefixed with `"_"`) which allow us to simplify their readability and increase their reusability.
