# SANDS

Welcome to the SANDS wiki!

The schemata SANDS were developed in the scope of the [Human Brain Project](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/) and [EBRAINS](https://ebrains.eu/) (European Brain ReseArch INfraStructure).

SANDS is an acronym for Spatial Anchoring of Neuroscience Data Structures and contains a collection of metadata schemata, which are going to be used to model the spatial dependencies of datasets inside the [EBRAINS Knowledge Graph](https://kg.ebrains.eu).

The development of these schemata is a cooperation between the development teams of the interactive atlas viewer, the spatial search, the Knowledge Graph and the EBRAINS Data curation team.

The goal of this collection of schemata is to enable the registration of data points into the HBP atlases (hosted on EBRAINS). SANDS acts as an extension to openMINDS, which handles the modelling of the metadata.

NOTE: SANDS is still in development and not yet fully implemented and used.
