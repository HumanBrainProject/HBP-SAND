    "description": "The atlas is an open access volumetric atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat brain. The delineations are defined in isotropic magnetic resonance (39 μm) and diffusion tensor (78 μm) images acquired ex vivo from an 80 day old male rat at the Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy. Coordinates for navigating the volume are provided by the Waxholm Space coordinate system. The location of bregma and lambda are also identified as anchors towards stereotaxic space.\n\nThe atlas (with MRI/DTI anatomical volumes, delineation- and label files) is hosted at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/whs-sd-atlas/ along with configuration files for ITK-SNAP, the Mouse BIRN Atlasing Toolkit, and PMOD.\n\nThe atlas has been adopted as the standard rat brain atlas for the EBRAINS infrastructure, see https://ebrains.eu/service/rat-brain-atlas/.\n\nThe atlas (RRID: SCR_017124) is shared under the CC BY-SA 4.0 licence. Note that the licence was changed to from CC BY-SA-NC to CC BY-SA on October 1, 2021.",
