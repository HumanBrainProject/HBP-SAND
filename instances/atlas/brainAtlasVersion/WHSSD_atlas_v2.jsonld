Version 2 of the Waxholm Space atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat brain contains 13 new and updated delineations of the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal region, and 66 structure delineations unchanged relative to v1.01. This dataset is hosted on NITRC.org and includes: WHS_SD_rat_atlas_v2.nii.gz: delineation file with anatomical structures; WHS_SD_rat_atlas_v2.label: text file naming anatomical structures; MBAT_WHS_SD_rat_atlas_v2.zip: file describing a suggested hierarchy of the anatomical structures.
